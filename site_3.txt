Speaker 1 00:00:43
Hello. 
Speaker 2 00:01:00
Hello.
Speaker 1 00:01:01
Hi.
Speaker 2 00:01:01
How are you. 
Speaker 3 00:01:09
Doing pretty good.
Speaker 2 00:01:16
Hold on a second. I'm typing out a little.
Speaker 1 00:01:33
All right.
Speaker 2 00:01:34
So, this meeting is going to be a little all over the place. So, I have my end-of-life general meeting with our VP, Rick Hornby, right? Which, like, we've talked about this a little bit. He wants to know about what we're doing. All right. with all our sites and sales sites and then the support sites.
Speaker 2 00:02:04
and then what we call everything else, right? Which is why I've been, you know, we talked about last time some slides and charts and graphs. I'm just going to try to paint a picture here real quick. So I got to talk about the usual stuff like how we're doing our faceband swaps. We've got issues with harvesting, you know, where our status is on kicking off projects and doing stuff and how we get to SA and then talk about sales, right?
Speaker 2 00:02:37
Sales basically that they can't do any more than what they have with the 5,000 sites which you've separated, right? And those things you've been doing, it's all kind of pulled into getting ready for SA. It really is part of this baseband stuff here. So maybe I should move down a little bit. But the overall point is, I'm trying to get out of this revolving door of identify, categorize everything, right?
Speaker 2 00:03:12
So what I'm trying to do next week is say, hey, this is everything that we plan to do this year and in the future years. And this is what you identified those projects, and then the support, and then what hardware it is, which you didn't even do the Samsung stuff. We might try to do that later. But forget about that for a minute. You did the Dust, 5216, the Spider Cloud, right? We didn't even do radios. But you identified all that stuff.
Speaker 2 00:03:43
And that's just the plan, right? Not even the full plan for the next couple years. So I'm going to try to kind of sum it up here. I need a new title for this. So what I'm trying to say is all this work that I'm showing up here, all those things. you identified as into support, called out the hardware, all this stuff, along with we also do 10 million a year on DAS, and like DAS year over year, that I have to kind of.
Speaker 2 00:04:14
manage and select, and then there's going to be new into support hardware that comes in, and we have what we call our network priority sites, which should now be identified and viewed, that's one thing we're going to check in a second, because I'd like to get those filtered out too by you in one of your spreadsheets. The point is, all that stuff is going to keep us busy for the next, maybe I shouldn't say 10 years, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, let's call it 5 years, all this stuff's going to keep us busy for the next 5 years, they all said they're busy for the next 5 years working.
Speaker 2 00:04:50
their 5,000 sites, right, so my point is, why do we care about everything else? Why do we care about everything else, right? I think the initial idea was sales could take it and sell it, they can't.
Speaker 2 00:05:21
Now I don't think that's going to be a good enough answer for him, so my next slide what I want to do is, or from this point what I want to do is launch into some of the stuff we talked about, which includes things that pop in what I want. So we can chart and graph some of this stuff, like this is a good one, we can say, hey look.
Speaker 2 00:05:55
at all our Indusport hardware by sub-market, this is part of that. What we're working on, we can do different looks at this stuff, right? Buy hardware and all this. I'll throw some of these charts and graphs at them. But the next thing I wanted to do was maybe go back to some of your slides. I'm going to use what you did, right. 
Speaker 3 00:06:24
Let's take a look.
Speaker 2 00:06:25
But I also want to do the next thing. I was trying to get out of this, but I think we need to do it. So basically what I want to have, I want to use the NS4 hardware by market slide. I think that's important. But on the chart, that one's a good one.
Speaker 2 00:06:56
I want some sort of chart showing. between the sales list, I don't know what to compare that to, and then the, I want to compare these to everything else, so I guess, let me try to think of it this way, if we say AllSpy minus the sales list, right, that's like 5,000 sites, and then we also subtract.
Speaker 2 00:07:40
the end of support hardware, right, that you identified, and then we subtract the priority sites, how many sites would, or hardware, probably just a couple thousand, right? This, there's not even 1,000.
Speaker 2 00:08:10
And then we have everything else. I want to show, I guess I want to show the numbers. I want to chart this somehow. And then I want to chart the everything else separately by category, which will be blank, I don't know, 50% of the time.
Speaker 3 00:08:44
All right, so let's go to your, so here we have all the industry reports. Yeah, so real quick, let me take a look at my Google Drive. I have something that might help you with this real quick. It's just a photo. Now we can, I just wanted to show it to you so that, just so you have an image in your head, one second, because I think there's a couple ways to look at things. Yes, so this is kind of one of the things I do well with. I'm going to share an image to you and you should see it.
Speaker 3 00:09:27
This is, you might get a notification in Gmail or email or Slack right now. It should be like a Google Drive photo notification. Yes, this is one way I look at it. Now this is like one way to visualize the clusters of sites. This was for our tables, for our venues and our equipment and our events. Ours would be a different.
Speaker 3 00:10:00
But just a quick, like, this is one of the photos or analytics I can run that will make the rows of data answer the question that you just stated, which is, well, I have all sites, but, like, 3K, 5K, and 1K of them are kind of this different cluster that really are a different category. How can we represent that and visualize that? This is one additional tool we can have, which is the analytics of this stuff, that would be helpful for that. Just a note. I'm just trying to give you a note.
Speaker 2 00:10:33
Yeah, that'd be great. And that's where I'm going with this. I was hoping I could give you some homework to create.
Speaker 3 00:10:39
Oh, please. I do well with homework. I know that.
Speaker 2 00:10:43
Create some charts and graphs, right? Yeah. So where's the latest spreadsheet I should use. 
Speaker 3 00:10:52
Well, yeah, I think the all sites, I guess for me, like, we have the FUSE data, right? Fuse, AllSite, which was the dashboard view I created on my end, which I think you were visible, because I understand that 300,000 sites is a lot on your browser, but for me it's not a lot of data locally on my computer when I run these programs. So, now if there's a sub-list of like 50,000 or 30,000 or 18,000 that contains all of these.
Speaker 3 00:11:29
5,000, 3,000, and 1,000 sites considered for sales, we can work with a smaller data set. But just keep in mind that the tools, the software that I'm using is leveraging the physical computation of the computer, not the browser, so I don't have the same limitations for speed and overhead that you're having with Google Drive and Fuse. So, when I run stuff locally on my computer, it allows me to do two things. It allows me to have...
Speaker 3 00:12:00
custom analytics. A, B, it allows me to work very quickly with large data sets. So just a heads up.
Speaker 2 00:12:11
Yeah, and that's why I'm hoping to do it like this. Like if we say mark for sale, right? I want to filter those out, right? So we just lost 5,000 sites, right? So how many, say we started with, why can't this give me a number? I don't want a total. I want 15,000 sites. We add the yeses. I assume this is everything, right? Start with 19,000 sites. I want to filter out the for sale,
Speaker 2 00:12:47
right? Because that's not, what I'm doing, I'm trying to get down to everything else, right? Okay. So mark for sale, sales is working those, right? So we removed those 4,000. So now we're down to 15. Then, I want to say End of Support Hardware, is there not a yes or no, I guess we'll just get rid of everything but the blanks, right? So now, oh wait, I don't want marks, alright, let me start over, I did something wrong.
Speaker 2 00:13:26
What did I do wrong? So that's all, I marked the blank. Alright, so we got, all we've done is excluded Marked for Stale, now I want to exclude the End of Support Hardware. Marked End of Support, so I just get rid of the yeses, right? Because again, all these are things we've already taken care of. Alright, so now we're down to 14,000. Now, now I want to exclude...
Speaker 2 00:14:02
Now I want to exclude something that's not in here. That's why I wanted to talk to you. Okay, all right, because where I'm going is after we exclude everything, then I want to chart it. So now if we look at this site, there's still network priority sites in here. There's not a ton of them, but I want to get rid of those, which means you've got to do all this over again. But it's a new thing in Vue. In fact, I don't even know if it's in Vue.
Speaker 2 00:14:33
The other thing we could do is look at get rid of VBG, because these should all be enterprise, right? Because that's why they're VBG. So if we exclude those, right, we're down another 1,300. And each one of these things I think would be great in the visuals you just put together, right? All these different data sets in that little picture that you're just showing. I think that would be really cool to show, Rick, right? Each one of these dots is one of those pieces. that we just excluded yeah we can do that now we're down to this and then.
Speaker 2 00:15:08
once we get down to this assuming we don't have it here but soon we have network priority sites and we excluded those it's only going to drop it another 500 or 1,000 sites so we're still gonna have like 12,000 sites what I want to do is chart these and we have to chart them I don't think we can chart it by anything other than category in building category right now airport.
Speaker 2 00:15:38
amphla theaters casinos convention centers NCAA pro sports that stuff is network priority site or at least network site so my point is a lot of these are going to disappear right a lot of these, that actually have these fields populated right here are going to disappear when we remove priority sites because these they're probably labeled.
Speaker 2 00:16:10
okay but once we do get rid of those priority sites I want to chart the these categories right and then there's multiple I mean at minimum you can chart the first category right it's a convention center who cares about other it's a store who cares about variety right just say it's a store I think that might be the best way to do it like we don't need to go into most of these don't say anything right they just say other you'll find a couple like Verizon.
Speaker 2 00:16:41
store that's important but let's see what else we have multi carrier building, enterprise so this is one of the issues on other on category one probably needs to be, decoded farther because you'll get other multi-building enterprise, other manufacturing, other warehouse, okay? So that's one that might, you might have to actually go to the second, category. But otherwise, education campus, I don't care if it's university, college, or high school,
Speaker 2 00:17:18
let's just leave it. So that's what I want to get to. I want to chart this. And what we're going to find is a lot of this is blank, right? So you're going to end up with the chart that says here's everything else. And of everything else, you know, here's some stores, there's a bunch of hospitals, government building, education, whatever, and percentages, maybe it's a pie graph, I don't, I think would probably be best. And then you're going to have just NA or unknown,
Speaker 2 00:17:50
right? And I want to show him that. And I want to show him that we don't know what they are, because we don't have it infused. And if it's not infused, I can't tell you what it is, and we need to see what the number of this is, right? We need to see how much we're really missing, right? Because I can't be held responsible to fill in all these blanks, right. 
Speaker 3 00:18:15
Yeah, I hear that, yeah.
Speaker 2 00:18:19
So do you think you can make this one chart end for me and make your little picture and try to figure that out with all these 19,000 sites? Now, remember, we're only focused on these in buildings.
Speaker 3 00:18:37
Yeah, we only, okay, yeah. In building and venue, yeah. And it looks like, well, we can have the data brain map or whatever. It can include in building BBG in the sense that it excludes it, but.
Speaker 2 00:18:55
Right, yeah, in your map. In the map. Only in the chart.
Speaker 3 00:18:57
Yeah, only in the chart.
Speaker 2 00:18:58
We need to exclude this.
Speaker 3 00:19:00
That's fine, because we can have line charts, pie charts, and graphs on top of the brain map. What I showed you, I call a brain map, just because it looks like neurons.
Speaker 2 00:19:11
You know what? Now that I'm thinking about it, these should be newer sites. You understand why we're excluding these? Because I know for a fact that they're enterprise sites that were built recently, that were paid for by VBG for success-based, or paid for by the customer. Meaning, they're relatively new, and we should know what they are. There will be sites within this, especially this category here in building,
Speaker 2 00:19:46
that are older, that were built by VBG. But, we don't know that. Alright, so let's pivot to one thing here. I don't have the full hour. Well, maybe I'll join this other meeting late. All right, so what I want to do now is two things. The first one is we've got to make sure, can we even get network priority sites filtered out?
Speaker 2 00:20:19
I don't know if it's done, but let's go look. Let's find something we know for a fact is, like, a network priority site and see if, I'm just trying to see if this field is in gear. Lucas Oil Stadium, right? That's where the Colts play. I've worked there for years and years before I moved to Michigan.
Speaker 2 00:20:51
In Indianapolis. I've also worked on, yeah, I lived in Indianapolis forever. Venue ID. So what I'm doing, I'm looking to see if there is a network priority field that's been added to FUSE. It's supposed to have been added recently, or maybe it's not added and it will be soon. Maybe it's not in here yet. I don't know.
Speaker 2 00:21:21
I would think it'd be in here, because this is where we have our source OEM distribution. Like, see, this is the problem, right? I know this is a comm scope tab. This should be populated, and it's not. That's probably my fault, because I built it a long time ago, but I have a contractor of it. Anyway, so here you can see there's pro sports NFL, category one and two. I don't think it's super important to say it's NFL.
Speaker 2 00:21:55
Let's just say it's pro sports, right? But what I'm looking for here... In building and venue, I'm looking for the network priority, and I don't see that it's here, so let's forget that for now. Let's just work off your current data set, because apparently they haven't introduced the network priority side, but the point would be things like major airports and NFL stadiums or college stadiums, there will be a field here, a field added here pretty soon that says network priority, yes or no.
Speaker 2 00:22:29
And this one would be a yes, right? Most sites will be a no. There's only like 500 or 1,000 priority sites. But the point is, if we go back to my little slide deck, BAU, this is what we work on. We spend a lot of our money every single year at the same places, right? We go back to the Chicago O'Hare Airport, and we expand it.
Speaker 2 00:23:00
We update it. We go back to Lucas Oil Stadium, add millimeter weight. We go back to the college arena, basketball, you know, the concert play. We keep adding stuff, right? We always have to turn it over. So we touch them every week. They're just in a round-robin life cycle, right, of adding stuff to these network priority sites. Again, right, think major venues, right? Super Bowl arenas, right. 
Speaker 3 00:23:28
So quick question, and let me know if, we don't need to do this for me, but would you mind sharing this slide to me as a read-only? That way I can't accidentally change something. But seeing this does help me read through the data, and it does help me, because I don't need edit access. I really shouldn't. I can literally click a mouse and accidentally change something. So it does help me think about the data and how it will help you show this.
Speaker 3 00:23:59
other people. Okay, good. Great.
Speaker 2 00:24:02
Yeah, and I made a, slide deck and shared it with you.
Speaker 3 00:24:07
I do have that, and I did contribute to that one also. Just a heads up.
Speaker 2 00:24:11
Yeah. I need to open, what do I call that? I need to open that one. I got something.
Speaker 3 00:24:17
And I ran, in that one I contributed two slides that kind of show you how my mind works and what kind of analytics I can provide in addition to what, like the hard, like basic sales, market numbers and stuff like that. Well, let's look at that.
Speaker 2 00:24:33
Yeah. Let me pull that up.
Speaker 3 00:24:35
on the screen. And you might find it interesting what I was able to find given my limited knowledge and limited access to limited history. But you'll see the type of.
Speaker 2 00:24:46
What did I name it. 
Speaker 3 00:24:47
Well, that was the November one. So there's like the monthly November update. I might be able to.
Speaker 2 00:24:56
Oh, I just shared the I just shared the, the whole thing with you from...
Speaker 3 00:25:01
Well, so we have, the IBV sites, EOS, and the rest. It says November 2025 IBV sites, and I'm loading it. I'm trying to load it. The slide deck is.
Speaker 2 00:25:18
called that? Well. 
Speaker 3 00:25:22
yeah, let me... What's the name of the.
Speaker 2 00:25:24
slides up here. 
Speaker 3 00:25:25
Here, I will Slack it to you. So, in your personal Slack, I just gave you the link.
Speaker 2 00:25:39
IBV sites, EOS, and the rest. Okay. Yeah. Sorry. The name.
Speaker 3 00:25:45
is like whatever. All right. And then, yeah, so we have your slides. 
Speaker 2 00:25:49
which I... Yeah, you can work here.
Speaker 3 00:25:51
And so I added 7 and 8. It reveals structurally how the database was set up, which says a lot about the sites themselves.
Speaker 2 00:26:12
This is great, but I can't present this to a VP. He's going to want, he's going to be like...
Speaker 3 00:26:18
No, I get it. I get it.
Speaker 2 00:26:21
What's the point? The point is the database sucks and our data sucks.
Speaker 3 00:26:25
No, the point is money. I get it. And then slide 8 says some things.
Speaker 2 00:26:36
Yeah, you're right about this. Oh, that's interesting. Growth factor per site. What does that mean? You can tell that the site... it's physically adding equipment hardware i think you can tell how much project i do the project i.
Speaker 3 00:27:06
think you can see the flow of money because the data knows how much stuff is being changed that data is only changed after economic investments being put into that location i, thought that was interesting i don't know if we can use it right now but in the future it could be.
Speaker 2 00:27:26
yeah it would be because we can i'll have to tell you more about the pegasus thing maybe we can connect this to pegasus okay but they i what's the what is the growth that you can see though is it based on a project being added infused or what it's it's based on so there's like so you.
Speaker 3 00:27:48
have a project id and then yes you have a project id and then you can track how many change sites are being added or removed for that site if that makes sense so if we have a project or a location, And we can see how many installations are being added to it.
Speaker 2 00:28:04
So it's projects under a single site, right? You're not talking about total number of sites.
Speaker 3 00:28:09
I guess I got it flipped around, but yeah.
Speaker 2 00:28:13
No, that's good. I get it. So that's cool. I think that is really interesting. All right, perfect algorithmic distribution. What the hell does that mean. 
Speaker 3 00:28:24
Well, yeah.
Speaker 2 00:28:25
Of course, they were the computer-generated site IDs. Yeah, that's a good point, too. Unlike how we do our eNodeB IDs, right, they have a prefix. It's like a phone number to keep them in an area. Right.
Speaker 2 00:29:00
And, yeah, that's definitely true. I think, yeah, this is really interesting here. Because you're right, we used to use different number of digits. Yeah, I didn't keep working on this, but we, you know, I can't really tell the bot, hey.
Speaker 3 00:29:17
No, I get it.
Speaker 2 00:29:17
Your database stuff is more like an answer, right? Yeah. Like, how do we fix it? What do we do to make it better. 
Speaker 3 00:29:26
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2 00:29:27
I thought you poorly invested your money, which is probably true.
Speaker 3 00:29:34
Sure. That's okay. I just wanted to, this was literally an afternoon of effort on it. It was something I wanted to contribute because I thought it would be an exercise we could just be aware of. I understand that the slide 3, 4, 5, and 6 are much more important and are what matter to these people, so.
Speaker 2 00:29:55
Yeah, to these people. I think there's something good here.
Speaker 3 00:29:58
Okay. I don't. I don't mean to be disparaging to the management at all, actually. I really want to be supportive.
Speaker 2 00:30:09
I think this is part of something bigger, right? So I think you should keep doing it. And we can talk about it later as it pertains to another project, which is the FUSE data integrity improvement, you know, getting more data in, right? Like once we load, once we get to the point where we're actually uploading data into FUSE to fill some of those holes, right, then you can start, we can start talking about this, right? Like, for example, we can say, hey, remember all these that were blank. 
Speaker 3 00:30:42
Yeah.
Speaker 2 00:30:43
Now they're not blank, right? Whatever, I lost the right screen, but you know what I'm saying, right? Hey, all these were blank, right? And now we... populated all this stuff, right? It used to be blank. We populated all these source OEMs, distribution OEMs, so, but anyway, the point was, can you work, or you can work, you should work. Yep. Can you try to make me some, like, graphs? Yeah. That you can drop in here. Yeah. That, like we just went over that shows the everything else. Chart it every way you can. The most important way, like I said, is the category, the building category.
Speaker 2 00:31:32
Right? The everything else by building category here, and you might have to use building category two. Right. Depending on what it says, you can play around with it. I'd like to chart everything else by these two, or by this one, and if there's any other way you think is good to chart it, like we could chart, we could say how many total everything else sites. exist in each market, right?
Speaker 2 00:32:02
Maybe there's some markets that we could show we don't know what the hell they have, meaning Central Texas did not do a good job of populating the category information, but, you know, mountain plains did, right? We could also look at distribution hardware and source OEM, right, and chart those. Again, these are going to be full of blanks and holes, right? So I'm curious how you can start to chart that.
Speaker 2 00:32:36
You could also do in-building versus venue, right, and make a pie graph and say, hey, look, in-building is 90%, venue is 10%, right. 
Speaker 3 00:32:45
So quick question.
Speaker 2 00:32:46
You can do it by site subtype.
Speaker 3 00:32:48
Yeah, quick question. In the Slack, we don't have to do it right now, but now would also work. All I need to know is what columns do you care about, and then my, data will have every permutation or every option selected or unselected and I'll be able to work with that. So I just need to know the columns you want to have in the November bar charts and slides and once I know all those columns, then I can go to work.
Speaker 3 00:33:19
Because I'll figure it out. I get what you're saying.
Speaker 2 00:33:32
Alright, so let me try to do that now. So number one is going to be the category and remember we're just doing everything else. I think the other ones are done for now. If you have ideas on the other charts that I made and you want to change them, you can help yourself. It would be nice if you could make these wider, so I don't care about the square footage. Venue category one, that is the most important and then you might need two. So I'll put that in the Slack.
Speaker 3 00:34:01
Okay.
Speaker 2 00:34:02
That's what they're called. That's the one we have to have, venue category one. And you see what I was saying? You can use venue category one almost by itself. But in some cases, you're going to have to go to venue category two to get what the hell is it, right? If it says other manufacturing, other warehouse, if it just says other, just leave it as other. But I'd like to, you know, break some of that down, right?
Speaker 2 00:34:38
High-rise, commercial, I don't give a crap that it's commercial, right? But you just have to do it and see what it looks like. But in most cases, I don't care about category two. You only need it where, see, here's a good example, other, other. You're just going to say other for the category. But in some cases, it's going to say other and then something important. Like here, other multi-building enterprise campus. Well, I'd rather, I guess you're just going to have to see how many there are.
Speaker 2 00:35:12
Maybe we can just leave them as other. In fact, yeah, let's just do Category 1. I'm looking at this and thinking, I don't know that it's worth it. All right, take back what I said. We're just going to do Category 1. Forget about, then you Category 1. That's the main item. All right, and then, Jerry.
Speaker 2 00:35:43
Jerry calls to chart. Let me think of what else. So you're wanting me to tell what other ones might be worth charting. So I'm going to choose.
Speaker 3 00:35:57
Because it's easier for me to make five charts. and we only use three of them, then for me to make three of them, and I've missed something important.
Speaker 2 00:36:06
All right, so we're going to do site type, subtype, market, make sure I got the right one, not market or submarket, oh, yeah, two others, distribution.
Speaker 2 00:36:46
hardware and source of the end, and that'll be it. And I don't know that we'll use them all, I just want to see what they look like.
Speaker 3 00:37:00
And sometimes once you see it, you know, sometimes you can't project that well into the future. The other thing is, if we can also just get a copy link for this explicit Google Drive docs, then that way I know it's for sure this one, because I know we've shared a couple. Can we copy the link in the share button? Yeah, if we can, thank you, yeah, if we can place, send this to me in the Slack also, it's all right there in the same message, great, okay.
Speaker 2 00:37:32
Yeah, this is the latest one you ran, and I know it's right because it had 19,000 records, right? And that's because we pulled in this VBG category. I know you had to go outside of this and pull in macro and small cell for some other exercises, but I don't want to include all that here.
Speaker 3 00:37:55
Okay, that's fine, this will be easier to understand.
Speaker 2 00:37:56
That's another problem we need to fix, yeah. Yeah, that's one of many problems we need to fix. I'm working through that now at the market to recode any of these.
Speaker 3 00:38:06
Okay.
Speaker 2 00:38:08
All right. So one other thing I was going to tell you real quick, I sent you this just so I didn't forget in Slack. I found a bug in Fuse. In Fuse, if you have an in-building site, you have field options for the source OEM and the distribution hardware OEM, right? These two fields right here, these are specific to in-building, right? We have those added for us. Now, when they added this new site type, in-building-VBG,
Speaker 2 00:38:41
again, relatively new, right, to understand what VBG is doing, which is all enterprise, they did not, those, with this site type, I did a bunch of samples. These two fields do not exist in Fuse. So that is above here, right? So it's really interesting. Under cell info, these two fields, they don't show up when the site type is that dash BBG.
Speaker 2 00:39:14
This is a venue in building works, but if it's in building stats, dash BBG, it's similar to a macro or a small cell where those don't show up at all, these two fields. So that's also, you know, that's the kind of stuff that we're finding, right, and trying to fix. So you might run into something like that. So I have this out to the coder, Milton, who I'm going to introduce you to eventually before you start overloading.
Speaker 2 00:39:45
Before you start over or uploading and overriding data, I'll have to introduce you to him now. And this is your path to getting on full time or whatever.
Speaker 3 00:39:57
Okay, Milton, to work with Milton. This is our.
Speaker 2 00:40:02
Yeah, he's not a manager, but he is, I'll say he's in charge of everybody in our group, our whole in-building HQ team. Yeah. He is the main tools group. He's the guy that can do the stuff that you're doing, but he's too busy to help me, right. 
Speaker 3 00:40:20
Oh, okay.
Speaker 2 00:40:21
He can probably, he'd probably understand, you guys could probably talk a lot more about data, right? That's kind of his deal.
Speaker 3 00:40:29
Well, that would be great to know that because I, you know, I do have a high bandwidth to just get stuff done. That's technical.
Speaker 2 00:40:37
Right, yeah, so maybe I'll try to bring you into, we have a meeting coming up, maybe I'll see if you mind if I invite you, because I'd like to say, I want to explain to him you've been helping me, and I want you to start uploading data, and maybe he can also give you homework. So anyway, this is a good path to get more stuff.
Speaker 3 00:40:58
Yeah, because my contract ends in... May of next year, and I'm just at the office in New York City, so, you know, anything that would allow me to work on a couple projects that, you know, leads to a budget, that's kind of really what I'm looking at.
Speaker 2 00:41:13
Yeah, and that's what I'm saying, I can't probably keep you busy full-time, but Bill could, right. 
Speaker 3 00:41:19
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Speaker 2 00:41:23
Alright, I gotta go, because I'm 15 minutes late for this other meeting, I will set up a follow-up for Friday or Monday, because I gotta present to Rick Tuesday morning on the stuff we just talked about, so I'll set a follow-up up and get together, so thank you for your help, appreciate it.
Speaker 3 00:41:43
Yeah, no problem, okay, thank you, Jacob, I'll take a look, and I know you go by Jake, right, so, okay, well, I'll see you soon, I'll work on everything.
Speaker 2 00:41:54
And just ping me if you've got questions in the meantime, we can have a side conversation. If needed.
Speaker 3 00:42:02
Okay. Yep. Okay. Thank you.
Speaker 2 00:42:05
Alright. Have a good one.
Speaker 3 00:42:06
Bye for now. Bye.
