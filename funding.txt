Funding 


00:00:38 Speaker 1 
Hello? Hello? I'm here. Let me know if you can hear me.
00:01:03 Speaker 2 
hey carol hi um hi yeah let's go over this because i think there could be some frustration here on your end um so uh let me see how i can help yeah um i just i have a lot of pressure to get this.
00:01:18 Speaker 3 
po approved but it seems like i mean i don't know what what to do i'm doing everything that people are trying to do because it's not working and just i'm wasting a lot of time when i i you know i'm being pulled in different directions and it's just today it's getting really really hard so well.
00:01:37 Speaker 2 
let's say at the end of the day let me help you so it's and it ends well i just need to see okay, so i have two questions can you delete a request after you made it no okay so once they're there.
00:01:51 Speaker 3 
they they're just there and then ellen rejects them yeah yeah and then ellen said that she was going to i know that she has the ability of course to delete the request.
00:02:02 Speaker 2 
she does but you do not yeah I don't okay well that's okay um so first question so it looks like you made several requests in the last week which ones um were the ones that were made today were you trying to make them the budget year 2026 yes for all of them and that's the other thing because.
00:02:25 Speaker 3 
she says that on her end they showed as 2025 and now I know I didn't put you know I did it I know.
00:02:33 Speaker 2 
because I I I made them 25 in the middle part of this day because so when you submitted it you meant for it to be 26 but I didn't know that you needed it to be 26 when I made my change.
00:02:46 Speaker 3 
everything needs to be pushed yeah everything needs to be 2026. that's fine so yeah okay so.
00:02:54 Speaker 2 
what I can do right now is can you give me all of the IDs like uh 28 20 21. last five days all of the IDs that you submitted and then I can review them one by one with you and you can just let me know what your needs to be I think I need a fix for your browser literally five minutes ago but since you can't delete yeah since you can't delete these requests let's just update the ones you.
00:03:25 Speaker 3 
have and then hopefully next time the year works okay so these are the ones that I requested and I know that I did one in power went through 28 22 I don't know why that one went through but I know that that purchase order and I.
00:03:57 Speaker 3 
don't know you're not familiar with the purchase order system right. Okay, yeah, so I don't know, it was, this was a 2025 PO, and what I did, I changed the date in the, in ESA, and put a 2026 date, then I went to the tool and requested funding for that 2026, it went through, so I thought maybe it was out of order, you know, the request, the way I'm putting them, I'm supposed to do one thing before I do the other, I know, I try everything,
00:04:33 Speaker 3 
I try a different browser, I try incognito, and nothing. So, let me give you the last one, the last two that I submitted for, do you want me to give you the SPM number. 
00:04:47 Speaker 2 
Yeah, actually, let's do any of them in the last, anything that you need approved, just give me all of them, and then we'll go and make sure which year is which.
00:04:55 Speaker 1 
Okay.
00:04:56 Speaker 2 
It's starting to sound like there could be... A deeper issue with this that may not be your browser, but I wouldn't know because I am new to the application I'll have to study it and maybe get you a longer-term fix not just for you.
00:05:12 Speaker 3 
But for everyone can it can it be my computer in general because I know my computer is rubbish I'm trying to change it there.
00:05:25 Speaker 2 
It's really weird because right now you're the only Requester that's showing this problem and the database. So I know you're trying It looks like it could be my problem, right? It could be but I don't think it's you using it, There's something going on with your computer, Everything you're describing you did correctly incognito and other browsers. So let's just try to, Clean up everything right now for what you need done today and just be mindful that.
00:05:56 Speaker 2 
It's hard with the Christmas coming up. Maybe in January I can help you and I can spend more time on this to give you a proper fix.
00:06:04 Speaker 3 
Yeah, I'm totally okay with that. The only thing that I want is just those two that I need to push forward for Ellen because those are 2025 and those are the ones that she's asking me to do. So let me give you the first one.
00:06:20 Speaker 2 
Yep, just send every single request I need.
00:06:24 Speaker 3 
It's just two of them.
00:06:25 Speaker 2 
It's just two? But I thought 2820 and 2821 were wrong because they were marked as 25, not 26.
00:06:34 Speaker 3 
Well, 2820 is now 2823 and 28... And then the other one is now 2,024 because she deleted the other one.
00:06:45 Speaker 2 
Oh, she deleted the other one.
00:06:46 Speaker 3 
Because, again, she saw that they were for the budget year 2025. I see. So she thought I did that and deleted the lines.
00:06:54 Speaker 2 
That makes sense.
00:06:54 Speaker 3 
So I have to do another request.
00:06:57 Speaker 2 
Okay.
00:06:58 Speaker 3 
So these are the latest numbers.
00:07:00 Speaker 2 
Okay.
00:07:03 Speaker 3 
It's at 2,823.
00:07:06 Speaker 2 
Yeah.
00:07:07 Speaker 3 
And the other one is 2,824.
00:07:20 Speaker 2 
Okay. So let me update these real quick.
00:07:29 Speaker 1 
Okay.
00:08:14 Speaker 2 
okay they've been updated and they both have okay so do you think they're going to go through now.
00:08:20 Speaker 1 
they should they should right okay she should be able to see the tool but it's refreshing let me.
00:08:52 Speaker 3 
and you know what this is funny because i started having issues this issue right after uh they re-image.
00:09:00 Speaker 2 
my laptop whoa that is an important detail thank you for letting me know you said a re-image.
00:09:08 Speaker 3 
I'm sorry I didn't mention that. Now it's just like it clicked like, yeah, because my laptop has been rubbish from the minute I got it.
00:09:16 Speaker 1 
Okay.
00:09:17 Speaker 3 
I got a really bad laptop. So I called the help desk, and they re-imaged my computer. And after that, I started having issues with this tool.
00:09:27 Speaker 2 
Really? Thank you. That's a really important detail. That can cause problems.
00:09:34 Speaker 3 
Yeah. I think maybe they left something out. They left things out. I know that because I have felt it, but this is the only one that has been really important. Okay. I can see the request in the spreadsheet now. Oh, good. I see 2823 and 2824. Perfect. Okay. So I'll let Ellen know, and then we'll deal with it. with the other stuff you know i don't care about the other stuff because i think it's fine these aren't the only one that she's worried about so if there's any other issues and then i'll i'll do the same thing and then let you know tomorrow but there are not many.
00:10:05 Speaker 3 
trust me it i promise it's just like i think it's five but i know for sure too i need to confirm the.
00:10:13 Speaker 2
